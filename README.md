Observations 
1.  Top Run Scorers
•	The first chart highlighted the leading run scorers.
•	Brendon McCullum, Virender Sehwag, and Ross Taylor stood out with consistent contributions.
•	These players formed the backbone of their batting line-ups by scoring heavily over many matches.
2. Best Strike Rates (Minimum 50 Balls)
•	The second chart focused on strike rate efficiency, i.e., how quickly players scored runs.
•	Steven Smith had the highest strike rate (~155), followed by Jacob Oram and Nuwan Kulasekara.
•	Power hitters like Shahid Afridi, Virender Sehwag, and Brendon McCullum also featured, showing their aggressive batting style.
3.  Key Insight
•	High run scorers and high strike rate players are not always the same.
•	Some players (e.g., McCullum, Sehwag) appear in both lists, meaning they could score both big and fast.
•	Others (e.g., Steven Smith, Afridi) may not have the most runs overall but were extremely effective in quick scoring.
